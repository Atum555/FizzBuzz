# FizzBuzz
Learning how to use GitHub and also my first projet in c++.
If you have any sugestions feel free to help.

This is a simple FizzBuzz program.
Basically you enter a number and it will loop from 1 to the number you entered
Displaying either the number itself or a 'Fizz' if it is divisable by 3 and a 'Buzz; if divisable by 5.
